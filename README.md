# squigly-trace
A cute ray tracer written in Haskell.

The goal of this project is to write an efficient raytracer that can handle complex scenes. There are already a lot of C++ raytracers, so this one is in Haskell instead. I hope this project will teach me a little about the dark art of writing efficient Haskell programs,

May or may not currently be on hiatus.
