# squigly-trace
A cute ray tracer written in Haskell.

# to do
+ ~~Load textures from mtl files.~~
+ Add antialiasing.
+ Improve space partitioning and partition traversal.
+ Change to a realistic color mapping that doesn't distort hues.
+ Maybe make geometric functions more generic e.g. to support different partition systems.
